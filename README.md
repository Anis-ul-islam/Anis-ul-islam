### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Anisul Islam Opy
#### Being a Electrical and Electronic Engineer.

A self-motivated learner, I've acquired proficiency in a range of creative and technical skills through self-study, including Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, Adobe Premiere Pro, and some After Effects. Prior to commencing my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the International Islamic University Chittagong, I dedicated 10 months to teaching at Madrasa, a religious school.  During this tenure, I achieved notable recognition, winning the 1st prize in the Cosmic Case competition at the 4th International Space Carnival. Additionally, my academic achievements include being selected as a finalist in the Regional Round of the Physics Olympiad Bangladesh 2018.  In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about volunteering and managing various programs. I thrive in active engagement outside of my studies and enjoy taking part in diverse activities. Whether it's organizing events, coordinating programs, or contributing to community initiatives, I find fulfillment in making a positive impact beyond the classroom. This enthusiasm for volunteering and program management reflects my commitment to personal growth, community development, and leadership.
